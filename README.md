# Solitons

A lot of my PhD work involved working with solitons of various types, such as Q-balls, oscillons, boson stars, axion miniclusters, etc.
I think they are pretty cool and often don't get the attention they deserve.
This repo will serve as a place for me to "collect" solitons of varying types.
I think for each type, I will have like a little theory section that explains the math behind them, and then I will do some actual numerical computation of some kind to illustrate them.
Depending on the kind of soliton, dimensionality, number of parameters, perhaps it will be an animation, snapshot, visualization of some parameter space?
